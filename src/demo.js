// Conversation topic
const topic = `Let's design an application for people with ADHD that helps them complete household chores. 

The app would feature workflow automation where tasks have specific start and end times. Users must provide photographic proof of completion, which an LLM (like LLaVa or Gemma3) analyzes to verify task completion. 

If tasks aren't completed on time, the app takes over the screen, remains always-on-top, maintains focus, and prevents access to other applications until the task is marked complete.

Discuss the technical implementation details, user experience considerations, ethical implications, and potential features that would make this app effective for people with ADHD.`;
